                <p>The Shenyang Palace Museum is located in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. It is one of the two
                    complete imperial palace architectural complexes in China, second only to the Forbidden City in
                    Beijing. It was first built in the early Qing Dynasty (1625) by Emperor Taizu Nurhaci and Emperor
                    Taizong Huang Taiji, and was used as a royal palace before the Qing Dynasty entered the country. The
                    Shenyang Forbidden City covers an area of approximately 60000 square meters, with an architectural
                    style that combines Manchu characteristics and is deeply influenced by traditional Han architecture,
                    possessing unique artistic and historical value.</p>
                <div class="mini-title">The Shenyang Palace Museum is divided into three parts:</div>

                        the place where the emperor holds court meetings and offices.</li>
                    <li>Donglu: Built during the early Nurhaci period, it was mainly used for worship, including the
